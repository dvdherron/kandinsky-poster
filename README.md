# Kandinsky's Birthday
An attempt to recreate a Herbert Bayer poster for Kandinsky into a web layout using CSS grid. For the narrow screen version I had to imagine for myself how the original version could be rearranged. 

After working on the layout I led a workshop with my classmates at Hyper Island showing how I did it.
