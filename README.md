# Kandinsky's Birthday
[Here's the poster](https://dvdherron.github.io/kandinsky-poster/)

A CSS grid recreation of a Herbert Bayer poster design originally made for Kandinsky's 60th birthday. For the narrow screen version I had to imagine for myself how the original layout could be rearranged. 

After working on the layout I led a workshop with my classmates at Hyper Island in Stockholm showing how I did it.
